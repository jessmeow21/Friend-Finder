## Developer Notes
This app has its own server-side API using the Express.js framework. Express is the most widely used Node.js server framework. It quickly allows us to easily establish our API route and associated HTTP request methods. Routing is how we design our server to handle responses when a client makes a request at a specific endpoint, or URL. This server will listen for a specific type of request at a specific endpoint and when it hears that request, it will respond accordingly.
